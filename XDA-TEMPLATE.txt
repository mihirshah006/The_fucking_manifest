[SIZE="6"]Introduction[/SIZE]

We are PolyOS. We are legion.... Well, no not really, but we're a Custom ROM based off LineageOS 14.1, that's dedicated to bringing its users the best experience users want and need in terms of performance and stability. We have handpicked some of the most widely used features and integrated them into our ROM; but that doesn't mean we suffer in terms of performance, oh no! We have consistently been reported performing extremely well even after customisations,from all of our testers. Users love the quick, snappy interface and the limited, but useful features. We run the Qualcomm boost framework used by most OEMs in order to bring efficiency and quick response to the ROM. So what are you waiting for? Let's get PolyFied!
